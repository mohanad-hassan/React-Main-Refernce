// we use it rarely   , and in big projects .
//it  updates the states without blocking the ui from the user , we use with heavy operations .
//when we have a heavy function that it will take a time we grapp it inside useTransition , it provides also a boolean .
//for toggle between Loading  and show the result when it ends .
//Syntax  
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()
.
we set the function that we want to execute without blocking the ui in startTransition ( () => { }  )
//isPending is a boolean value that is false , and when the function ends become True  . 
we can use it in jsx  {isPending ?LoagingCompnent : otherCode}.

//we use it with Router to make navigations more smoothly but  i didnt try that .
