//note  , the js before return in executed just one time when you start the react project .
//useState holds the value of the state when the compnent rerender .
//changes the local variables doesnt trigger hte compnent to rerender .
// The useState Hook provides those two things:
  A state variable to retain the data between renders.
  A state setter function to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.
// Use are react Hooks that are only aviliable when rendernig compnent .
//GENERAL HOOKS RULES , always start with use and capiital letter after it .
//you have to use them inside compennt body .
//you have to call them on the toplevel of the component .
//dont use them without the specail function of rerencer .
//NOTE : AUTO BATHCING , example : if we have handleCLick function that contains setState for three useStates , when we click and trigger this function , will
the compnent rernder once or three times ? the answer is with react 18 it will rernder just once .
//in useState their is a function to hold the value , wich some times you will need
setState( (prev) => {
return prev+1
} ).

//with setTimeOut  always use the function of setState .
